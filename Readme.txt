Hey guys, here's the finished game!

I'm hoping to add some more features to it when I get a chance, like planets to collide with
 and a star field.
I included the .hex and .uze files as well as the complete source code for my game.
I also included an application I made which has aided me greatly in creating
my vector objects for all my polar objects.The project source can be found at
https://github.com/stache/UzeboxVectorObjectPlotter. Right now I've tested it on Windows 8, Windows 7, and Vista. It does need a current version of the .Net runtime to run properly.
 Not sure if it qualifies for the
technical breakthrough prize, but it's there just in case ;) 
 Thanks again for the  fun, and hope you  enjoy the game!
